Towson Software Engineering Club UI/UX challenge to replicate a mockup as closely as possible with the cleanest possible code. Mockup: https://www.figma.com/file/qj9rMJmuTWiiDQ6x2gCf9V/SEC-Expo-Site

### Challenge Details:
Software Engineering Club is also excited to announce our first ever UI/UX Challenge! 

Linked at the bottom of this email is a mock of a webpage that we are challenging people to replicate as closely as possible. You can use plain HTML and CSS or any JavaScript framework that you like to work with! (This is also a great opportunity to prepare for take home technical interviews!)

You will have the opportunity to present your final product at our Project Exposition on November 22nd for the opportunity to win a cool prize! Our judging panel will be looking at how closely the webpage resembles the mocks and the cleanliness of the code base.
